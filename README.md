# ESP8266 Shutters

> A straightforward solution to control shutters with an ESP8266 through Home Assistant & MQTT.

This is a simple system that allows users to control shutters by sending MQTT commands that will
be translated to electrical signals on three output pins.

I used this with my Somfy shutters by soldering wires coming from the output pins to a Somfy 
remote.

This README is minimalistic as I imagine this won't gain much attention, if so don't hesitate
